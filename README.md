# Budget Tracker ðŸ“Š
Budget Tracker is an application that can receive and store input for an account balance both on- and offline. This application demonstrates the importance of an app to be able to store data locally if internet connectivity is lost, and to update data once connectivity has been restored.

## Description

Budget Tracker is coded using information that the user seeds into a MongoDB database and managed with Mongoose. I made use of the the service worker and manifest files to work behind-the-scenes to be able to store any new information locally should connectivity be throttled or temporarily disabled. As the deployed site is active through Heroku, the Mongo database has been set up and connected with a MongoDB Atlas account.

## Installation

This project uses MongoDB, mongoose, morgan and Express.js. Install these packages if you do not have them on your local machine. 

## Usage

Launch the application with  ``node .\server.js`` in your terminal.
